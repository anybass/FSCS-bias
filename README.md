:monocle_face: Social Bias Analysis on the Swiss Judgment Prediction dataset in German, French and Italian. We perform the Social Bias Analysis using the Holistic Bias dataset by Facebook. :monocle_face:

In this repository, you find a Jupyter Notebook that makes use of two main datasets to investigate bias in the facts of legal cases:

:balance_scale: The [Swiss Judgment Prediction Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rcds/swiss\_judgment\_prediction) by Joel Niklaus

:rainbow: The [Holistic Bias Dataset](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ResponsibleNLP/tree/main/holistic_bias) by Facebook

Since we have many processing steps and you may be interested only in a part of them, we added intermediate files used in the notebook for easier reproducibility in a [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OAvhpBiCKeKGg1G6S3QCgkgUxGPFNjnG?usp=drive_link). We noticed that in some cases, the attention visualization may not render well, hence we share our results as image files via google drive for:
- [The summarization approach (seed 16)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1upZM9BpV1f7m6eTWClkj7PKpkizRi2AB?usp=sharing)
- [The chunking approach (seed 48)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YE8F8_xjCoVGKEjvmNJ0r-dmxtvgiz2c?usp=sharing)

# FSCS-bias
Social Bias Analysis on the Swiss Judgment Prediction dataset in German, French and Italian. We perform the Social Bias Analysis using the Holistic Bias dataset by Facebook.

In this repository, you find a Jupyter Notebook that makes use of two main datasets to investigate bias in the facts of legal cases:
- The [https://huggingface.co/datasets/rcds/swiss_judgment_prediction](Swiss Judgment Prediction Dataset) by Joel Niklaus
- The [https://github.com/facebookresearch/ResponsibleNLP/tree/main/holistic_bias](Holistic Bias Dataset) by Facebook

Since we have many processing steps and you may be interested only in a part of them, we added intermediate files used in the notebook for easier reproducibility in a [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OAvhpBiCKeKGg1G6S3QCgkgUxGPFNjnG?usp=drive_link](google drive folder).
